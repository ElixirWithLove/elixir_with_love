      <strong>Elixir with Love is a community-building conference!</strong>
      We want talks that introduce the best parts of Elixir to developers. We want to
      bring healthy workplace practices front and center to the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>Most of all, <strong>we want to bring everyone to the table</strong> in forging a strong open-source community for this elegant, powerful,
      and potentially world-shaping backend language. This means doing everything we possibly can to
      cultivate a positive, equitable environment for underrepresented groups.</p>
