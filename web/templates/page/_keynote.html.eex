      <strong>Elixir 1.6 is coming at the start of 2018!</strong> This talk will showcase new features, and a few old, that help meet our three main design goals: productivity, maintainability, and reliability. Expect a few tips and tricks along the way for Elixirists of any level of expertise.

      We talk about Elixir as powerful language. What about the power of community? I co-founded ElixirBridge, a volunteer-run organization that has free, weekend-long workshops in Elixir and Phoenix for underrepresented populations in tech. This talk explores what worked, what failed, and why community is important.

        Property-based testing is a technique that allows to reduce the number of unit tests and at the same time increase the robustness of a test suite by introducing randomness. It also changes the way you think about code. We now have a robust property testing library in Elixir, so time to jump into it!

        With Elixir and Phoenix, you can build robust and performant back-end services. With Elixir and Nerves, you can extend those back-end services into your physical space, whether it be sensors in a warehouse or Internet-connected devices spread across the globe. With Elm, you can create rich and maintainable user interfaces to your system without having to invest in dedicated JavaScript expertise. Your small team of Elixir developers can handle everything from sensors and devices to front-end code running in your browser, with minimal context-switching overhead.

      While porting a project from Ruby on Rails to Elixir/Phoenix (plus React), I’ve realized just how deceiving looks can be. “Ticket to Fly” focuses on finding solutions to unexpected challenges along the way. Specifically, we’ll look into working with images, a case for recursion, and fun with pipes.
